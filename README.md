# Employee Tracker
A handy little web app for taking and storing notes that demonstrates developers core competencies of working within Node/using Express to build an app that relies on API calls between client and server to store/retrieve user notes.

Future feature plans include:
- unique user ID/log-in
- storing user data (and app) outside of dev server
- adding security to storage
